                        Hey there! My name is Jacob Appelbaum. I'm
                        pretty famous for stealing other people's
                        researh and putting my own name on it. I also
                        spend a lot of my time pretending to be a
                        badass hacker, but actually I can only barely code.
                        I enjoy using my social capital, influence, and
                    </p>

                        power in order to manipulate other people into
                        getting what I want.

                        From all that, it's pretty clear that I'm awesome!
                        However, in several communities, I'm perhaps
                        better known for my <b>abuse</b> of other people â€”
                        sexually, emotionally, and physically.
